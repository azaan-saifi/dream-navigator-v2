Day-1
# 3 Kinds Of Arabic;
1) Street/colloquial Arabic; Arabic that changes from one place or region to another/different people speak Arabic differently like Arabic of Egypt, Arabic of Yemen, Arabic of Qatar etc.
   * Different dialects of a language in the world/in the same country
   An example of this in English would be how different people belonging to different countries pronounce 'water' differently.
2) Fusha (فَصِيح) ; proper modern day Arabic/Arabic spoken nowadays.
   For example; Arabic in newspaper, books etc.
3) Language of the ancient Arabs (لِسَان العَرَب) ; Arabic spoken 1400 years ago, i.e. the proper Arabic spoken in the old days.
   * Some important points;
   The ancient form of any language is more advance & complex & as time goes by it gets simpler & simpler. For example; compare shake sphere English to nowadays English.
   Word that means one thing today doesn't mean the same thing in the older days
   For example;
   English; cool & hot in older days were understood to be temperature but nowadays it means to like/good/impressive
   Arabic; اِسْتِعْمَارًا in old days meant to be buildup but nowadays it means colonization

So if someone know fusha Arabic they can't claim to know the Arabic of the ancient Arabs, fusha is a subset of lisanul Arab/if you consider the language of the ancient Arabs as pizza then fusha is a slice of it.

Grammar; words/vocabulary which are put in a specific sequence to make sense.

# 3 kinds of words in ancient Arabic;
Note; every word in the glorious Quran is one of these 3.
1) Harf (حَرف) ;
   In English it is called preposition but we will know it is more than that
   A word that doesn't make sense unless followed by another word.
   For example; in, at, of, to, the, on, by, with, until, for
   Where do you work? >>> at the (hotel)
   Where are you going? >>> to the (airport)
2) Fil (فِعل) ;
   In English it is called verb
   A word that is stuck in past, present & future/a word that is stuck in time
   For example; wrote, will teach, taught, teaching, learned, helps

3) Ism(اسم) ;
   The name of person, place, thing, idea, adjective, adverb & more
   In English it is called noun but it is more than that (Noun is the name of person, place, thing, idea)
   Examples of each;
   Person > Ahmad, she, her, they, who, that
   Place > ice-cream shop, ocean, park, Canada, New York, china
   Thing > screen, book, pen, cup
   Idea > is something that you can't touch (it is not physical)
   Ideas are mostly words ending with –tion & -ing (-ing words can be a fil also, it gets confusing in English but not in Arabic)
   Love, hate, jealousy, mercy, teaching, cooking, expectations, emotions, Islam, pandemic
   Adjective > words which describe person, place, thing, idea
   Red, beautiful, tall, short, ugly, pretty, happy, cool, hot, great, old
   Adverb > words end with Ly
   Happily, kindly, pleasingly, nicely, reluctantly, quickly, gently, slowly, highly, peacefully
   * Sometimes a fil can act as an ism (idea) if you can add 'the act of' to it, this is a problem in English only, not in Arabic
   For example;
   He is cooking (fil)
   He loves cooking (ism) > he loves the act of cooking
   They are reading (fil)
   They hate reading (ism) > they hate the act of reading

# 4 properties of ism;
Status, number, gender & type

## Status;
Raf, nasab, jaar (any ism in the Quran has to be raf, nasb, jaar)
1. Raf ;
   Doer of the fil.
   Find the fil & find who did it, ism that's a doer of a fil is raf (رَفع)
   Only ism can be raf, the ism can be a person, thing, idea.
   For example;
   A teacher (doer of the fil > raf) entered (fil) the classroom
   A student (doer of the fil > raf) of his was sleeping (fil) soundly
   The teacher (doer of the fil > raf) threw (fil) a pencil
   The teacher student (doer of the fil > raff) woke up (fil) suddenly
   ALLAH (doer of the fil > raf) created (fil) the earth
   My car (doer of the fil > raf) broke down (fil) (my isn't raf, it only tells you who the car belongs to, it can be that my cousin was driving the car)
   My anger (doer of the fil > raf) made (fil) me do it
   The messenger (doer of the fil > raf) of ALLAH taught (fil) us the Quran
   My anger (doer of the fil > raf) hurts (fil) me
   Maryam's dad (doer of the fil > raf) loves (fil) pool
2. Nasab;
   Details about the fil.
   1st you find the fil, then you find the doer of the fil (called raf), then details about the fil (called nasab)
   For example;
   I ate an apple outside yesterday quickly out of hunger
   First find the fil (ate) > main question (who ate it?) > I (raf) >investigation/detail questions > nasb
   Like
   What u ate? (an apple)
   Where you ate it? (outside)
   How you ate it? (quickly)
   Yo! When you ate it? (yesterday)
   Why you ate it? (out of hunger)
   My car (raf) stopped (fil) suddenly (nasb>how did it stopped?) last year (nasb>when did it stopped?) on the highway (nasb>where did it stopped?)
   * Last year isn't a fil > year is an idea & last is an adjective
   So both are isms
   * Whose car is it? (there is no fil in it so 'my' can't be nasb, because for nasb you need a fil)
3. Jaar;
   Whatever comes after of > jaar
   For example;
   Messenger of Allah (the word ALLAH > jaar)
   Laptop of ustadh (ustadh > jaar)
   House of Ibrahim (Ibrahim > jaar)

* Sometimes the word 'of' is hidden in a sentence so you have to re-arrange the sentence to find it. For example;
My car = car of mine (mine > jaar)
His house = house of his (his > jaar)
Your pen = pen of yours
Their religion = religion of theirs
ALLAHs book = book of ALLAH

## Raf, Nasb, Jaar in Arabic;
أٌ أًا أِ إبٌ بًا بِ تٌ تًا تِ جٌ جًا جِ > fat version/heavy version
أَ أُ إِبَ بُ بِتَ تُ تِجَ جُ جِ أُ > on diet/light version

Words ending with
U/UN = raf مُسْلِمٌ/مُسْلِمُ بَابٌ
A/AN = Nasb مُسْلِمًا/مُسْلِمَ بَابًا
I/IN = jaar مُسْلِمٍ/مُسْلِمِ بِابٍ

Few examples of all statuses combined;
I (doer > raf) lost (fil) my (cat of mine > jaar) cat (detail > nasb)
We (raf) learn (fil) Arabic (nasb) of the Quran (jaar)

Examples in Arabic;
* In English what comes 1st is the doer like;
Bob kicked joe (bob is the doer)
Joe kicked bob (joe is the doer)
But such is not the case in Arabic.
* In English we depend on the order to find the doer, details etc.
But in Arabic we depend on the sounds;
Doer > raf (UN/U) > red color
Detail > nasb (AN/A) > green color
helped > سَاعَدَ teacher > مُدَرِسْ student > طَالِب
سَاعَدَ الْمُدَرِسُ الطَّالِبَ > the teacher (raf) helped (fil) the student (nasb)
سَاعَدَ الْمُدَرِسَ الطَّالِبُ > the student (raf) helped (fil) the teacher (nasb)
اَلطَّالِبَ سَاعَدَ الْمُدَرِسُ > the teacher (raf) helped (fil) the student (nasb)

Quran examples;
وَقَتَلَ دَاوُدُ جَالُوْتَ
وَإِذِ ابْتَلِي إِبْرَاهِيْمَرَبُّهُ
إِنَّمَا يَخْشَي اللّٰهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعَلَمَاءُ
إِنَّ اللّٰهَ بَرِيْئٌ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ وَرَسُوْلُهُ

Day-2
## Masculine Muslim chart;
| جر | نصب | رفع |
|----|-----|-----|
| مُسْلِمٍ | مُسْلِمًا | مُسْلِمٌ | 1 |
| مُسْلِمَيْنِ | مُسْلِمَيْنِ | مُسْلِمَانِ | 2 |
| مُسْلِمِيْنَ | مُسْلِمِيْنَ | مُسْلِمُوْنَ | 3 |

1 Raf > UN, Nasb > AN, Jaar > IN (At the end)
2 Raf > Aani, Nasb/Jaar > Ayni (At the end)
3 Raf > Oona, Nasb/Jaar > Eena (At the end)

Examples;
مُتَّقِيْنَ (3N/J), مُتَّقُوْنَ (3R), اَلْمُؤْمِنُوْنَ (3R), الْعَالَمِيْنَ (3N/J), وَ مِنْ دُوْنِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ (2R), رَبِّ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ وَ رَبِّ الْمَغْرِبَيْنِ (2N/J)
بِسُلْطَان > Not 2R (because 2R ending is Aani not Aanin, it should be a finger print match with the chart)
* Always look for ending combinations (Aani, Aayni, Oona, Eena) 1st than ending sounds (UN, AN, IN)
* Sometimes Aani/Oona is part of a word, it doesn't mean 2/3
For example;
برهَانِالرحمَانِنعمَانِخانَعثمَانهَارَوْنَقُرْآنِ

## Feminine Muslim chart;
| جر | نصب | رفع |
|----|-----|-----|
| مُسْلِمَةٍ | مُسْلِمَةً | مُسْلِمَةٌ | 1 |
| مُسْلِمَتَيْنِ | مُسْلِمَتَيْنِ | مُسْلِمَتَانِ | 2 |
| مُسْلِمَاتٍ | مُسْلِمَاتٍ | مُسْلِمَاتٌ | 3 |

For examples;
آيَاتٌبَيِّنَاتٌسَمَاوَاتٌ (3NJ), آيَةٌ بَيْتٌ (1J)
* In 1 Nasb status a letter alif is added at the end (only in Muslim masculine not in Muslim feminine chart)
For example;
مُسْلِمٌ > مُسْلِمًا, غَفْوْرٌ > غَفُوْرًا, رَحِيْمٌ > رَحِيْمًا, كِتَابٌ > كِتَابًا
مُسْلِمَةً رَحْمَةً قِيَامَةً مَدِيْنَةً (stays the same)

Day-3
# 4 Properties Of Ism;
Status, Number, Gender, Type

## Status;
1) Form of status; (Raf, Nasb, Jaar)
2) How to tell status;
   a. By ending sounds (R > U, N > A, J > I)
   b. Ending combinations; (look for them first)
      i. 2 combinations;
         Aani (2R), Ayni (2N/J)
      ii. 3 or more combinations; (for people)
          Oona (3R), Eena (3N/J)
      iii. 3 or more feminine combinations;
           Aatun (3R), Aatin (3N/J)
   * 3 or more combinations (oona, eena) is used for people (used for creatures that possess intellect) like;
   believers/disbelievers, angels/jins, Humans etc.
   * So what about رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ > is it also used for people?
   Nurturing master (because master can be cruel) of the worlds of people.
   Allah isn't talking about worlds but rather people in it (by using Eena) because the whole Fatiha is talking about people.
   * ت مربوطه (ة) > is mostly used for singular (for human, usually for female) Like;
   مُسْلِمٌ > مُسْلِمَةٌ
   For non-human things we can't make it feminine by adding a ة
   For example;
   كِتَابٌ > كِتَابَةٌ (it doesn't exist)
   * When there is no R/N/J at the end of a word in a sentence (specially in Quran) it doesn't mean that it's not there, it's there but it has got a sukoon. If we don't say it doesn't mean, it's not present. For example;
   رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنِ, غَفُوْرٌرَحِيْمٌ, وَالْعَصْرِ
   c. Pronouns are crazy. They don't care about ending sounds/sounding combinations
3) Light vs heavy status;
   1. Masculine & feminine Muslim charts are heavy
   2. Every word in the chart can be light
   3. To make light either;
      a) Remove tanween (tanween is when a harakah becomes double)
      b) Remove extra N (ن)
   4. Making a word light means removing the extra ن, not any other ن. For example;
   نُعْمَانُ, فِرْعَوْنَ, هَارُوْنُ > Light because there is no extra ن
   5. There are 4 reasons to make a word light, without them a word should be heavy
   6. If there is Al (ال) on a word, then we don't care to ask the question of light vs heavy

## Light masculine Muslim chart;
| جر | نصب | رفع |
|----|-----|-----|
| مُسْلِمِ | مُسْلِمَ | مُسْلِمُ | 1 |
| مُسْلِمَيْ | مُسْلِمَيْ | مُسْلِمَا | 2 |
| مُسْلِمِيْ | مُسْلِمِيْ | مُسْلِمُوْ | 3 |

* When 1 nasab in masculine Muslim chart (An) becomes light (A), the alif goes away. For example; غَفُوْرًا > اَلْغَفُوْرَ

## Light feminine Muslim chart;
| جر | نصب | رفع |
|----|-----|-----|
| مُسْلِمَةِ | مُسْلِمَةَ | مُسْلِمَةُ | 1 |
| مُسْلِمَتَيْ | مُسْلِمَتَيْ | مُسْلِمَتَا | 2 |
| مُسْلِمَاتِ | مُسْلِمَاتِ | مُسْلِمَاتُ | 3 |

عَيْنَا
عَيْنًا (heavy) > عَيْنَ (light)
عَيْنَانِ (heavy) > عَيْنَا (light)

رَسُوْلَا
رَسُوْلًا (heavy) > رَسُوْلَ (light)
رَسُوْلَانِ (heavy) > رَسُوْلَا (light)

اَلْجَنُوْنَ > doesn't matter because it has Al (ال)

4) Flexibility of status;
   a) Fully flexible; are those words which can show all three statuses i.e. Raf (Un), Nasab (An), Jaar (In). Fully flexible words can be light.
   For example;
   صَالِحٌ صَالِحًا صَالِحٍ > صَالِحُ صَالِحَ صَالِحِ
   مَدِيْنَةٌ مَدِيْنَةً مَدِيْنَةٍ > مَدِيْنَةُ مَدِيْنَةَ مَدِيْنَةِ (because it is an Arabic name meaning city)
   * 4 prophets are Arabs > محمد,صالح,هود,شعيب

   b) Partially flexible; the status of non-Arabic words & proper name of places are Raf (U), Nasab (A), Jaar (A). The nasab & jaar version looks the same. Partly flexible words can't be heavy.
   For example;
   يَعْقُوْبُ يَعْقُوْبَ يَعْقُوْبَ
   فِرْعَوْنُ فِرْعَوْنَ فِرْعَوْنَ
   يَثْرِبُ يَثْرِبَ يَثْرِبَ

   c) Non-flexible; the status of non-flexible words in Raf, Nasb & Jaar is the same
   For example;
   موسي
   يحيي زكريا
   * When a word ends with alif, it is non-flexible, can be R/N/J. like دنيا, زكريا, سُقْيا
   * A non-Arab name having 3 words will be treated as fully flexible instead of partly flexible. For example;
   عَدْنٌ, اعد, نوح, لوط
   لُوْطٌ لُوْطًا لُوْطٍ نُوْحٌ نُوْحًا نُوْحٍ
   آدم > 4 words not 3 (ءادم)
   عيسي, موسي > 4 words not 3, 2nd reason > non-flexible words can't become fully flexible, only partly flexible words have a chance to become fully flexible.

## Flexibility 
| جر | نصب | رفع | |
|----|-----|-----|---|
| مُحَمَّدٍ | مُحَمَّدًا | مُحَمَّدٌ | Fully flexible (Heavy) |
| مُحَمَّدِ | مُحَمَّدَ | مُحَمَّدُ | (Light) |
| يُوْسُفَ | يُوْسُفَ | يُوْسُفُ | Partly flexible |
| مُوسِي | مُوسِي | مُوسِي | Non-flexible |

Day-4
## Broken plurals;
(I was so hopeful in my learning of Arabic until broken plurals happen & then I don't think I can learn Arabic, I think I am gonna quit, I think I will take up French, maybe I will learn cooking instead, stop it!!! Ustadh Nouman Ali Khan)

In English some words can be made plural by adding 's' at the end like;
Book > books, kid > kids

But that's not true for all words, there are some words that have unpredictable plurals/that can be made by messing with the original word (broken > something is taken out/added to) such plurals are called broken plurals. For example;
Mouse > mice, goose > geese, tooth > teeth

In Arabic the equivalent of 's' (words that have normal regular plurals) are > Oona, Eena, Aatun, Aatin.

Similarly, there are unpredictable plurals in Arabic which are made by messing with the original words or messing with the sound, these plurals are called broken plurals. For example;
مَسْجِدٌ > مَسَاجِدٌ (not مَسْجِدُوْنَ or مَسْجِدَاتٌ)
قَلَمٌ > أَقْلَامٌ (not قَلَمُوْنَ or قَلَمَاتٌ)
رَسُوْلٌ > رُسُلٌ, كِتَابٌ > كُتُبٌ, بَحْرٌ > بُحُوْرٌ

* Majority of plurals in Arabic are broken plurals
* Most of the broken plurals are partly flexible
* You can have a regular plural & a broken plural for the same word
For example;

| Broken plural | Regular plural | Singular |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| عُلَمَاءُ | عَالِمُوْنَ | عَالِمٌ |
| سَنَابِلُ | سُنْبُلَاتٌ | سُنْبُلَةٌ |
| كُفَّارٌ, كَفَرَةٌ | كَافِرُوْنَ | كَافِرٌ |

* Broken plurals don't have ending combinations rather ending sounds, how to know it > by vocabulary
If you see ending sound > it can be singular/broken plural
For example;
كِتَابٌ > book (UN ending sound > singular)
كُتُبٌ > books (UN ending sound > broken plural)
أَجْنِحَةٌ (broken plural > wings) although it sounds like مُسْلِمَةٌ
* In Arabic broken plurals are considered as singular feminine, so whenever they talk about a broken plural, they will talk about it as 'she'
For example;
Mariam bought 4 books (كُتُبٌ) . She read all of them (her) in a week & returned them (her) for a refund.
I visited to masjids (مَسَاجِد) . Some of them (her) were built a long time ago.

* In Quran angels & prophets are talked about as she not because they are female but because a broken plural is used.

## Number;
Singular (UN, AN. IN)
Pairs (Aani, Aayni)
Plurals;
1. Masculine plural (Oona, Eena) > it can be just men or it can be used for both men & women together
2. Feminine plural (Aatun, Aatin) > only used for females
3. Broken plurals > when the singular word is broken in the plural version. For example; masjid (مسجد) > masaajid (مساجد)
   a) Human broken plural (includes angels & jins) can be treated as 'she'. For example;
   Messengers (رسل) guided people. They were honest OR
   Messengers (رسل) guided people. She was honest.
   b) Non-human broken plurals (includes plants & animals) must be treated as 'she'
4. Plurals because the Arabs said so (they are singular but their meaning is plural)
   Qawm (قوم) > nation
   Naas (ناس) > people
   Qarn (قرن) > generation
   The plural of قوم is أَقْوَامٌ (human broken plural) & that of قرن is قُرُوْنٌ (human broken plural)

## Gender;
Masculine vs feminine > we will not spend time on masculine > masculine until proven feminine (innocent until proven guilty)
Feminine > real (biological female like mom, sister) + fake
Fake feminine;
1. Many words that end with آءْ يةْ ي
   Like > صفرآء, عميآء, بيضآء, شُرْيي, كُبْرَي, صُغْرَي, يُسْرَي
   Not all words like موسي, عيسي
2. Broken plurals
3. Feminine because the Arabs said so
   حَرْب (war), سَمآء (sky), شَمْس (sun), نَفْس (person), نَار (fire), دَلْوَ (bucket), طَرِيْق (path), سَبِيْل (path), أَرْض (earth), رِيْح (air), بِئْرِ (air), دَار (house), كَأْس (cup), خَمْر (wine), سَعِيْر (hell), جَهَنَّم (hell), عَصَا (staff)
   * There can be other words for the above ones but that doesn't necessarily mean that they will also be feminine. For example;
   For house > دار (feminine), بيت (masculine)
   For land > أرض (feminine), بدل (masculine)
4. Body parts in pairs (lips, ears, feet, elbows etc.)
   * Proper name of places > feminine

How to you identify a broken plural;
1. Singular (Un, An, In)
2. Pairs (Aani, Ayni)
3. Masculine plural (Oona, Eena)
4. Feminine plural (Aatun, Aatin)
5. Plurals because the Arabs said so
6. Broken plural > Human & non-human
   * If you see a word & it has ending sound it would be 1 or 6
   * Broken plural > pretend that it is singular feminine (plural in meaning, singular in grammar)

Examples;
اَلْجِبَالَ (mountains) > ending sound + plural in meanings > broken plural, since it is a non-human broken plural so > singular feminine (1F)

اَلنِسَاءَ (women) > ending sound + plural in meaning > broken plural, since it is a human broken plural we get 2 answers;
Grammar answer > 1F (human broken plural can be treated as 1F)
Reality answer > 3F (since women are plural & feminine by nature)

رُسُلٌ (messengers) > ending sound + plural in meaning > broken plural, since it is a human broken plural we get 2 answers;
Grammar answer > 1F (human broken plural can be treated as 1F)
Reality answer > 3M (since messengers are plural & masculine by nature)

اَلْمَلَائِكَةُ (angels) > ending sound + plural in meaning > broken plural, since it is a human broken plural we get 2 answers;
Grammar answer > 1F (human broken plural can be treated as 1F)
Reality answer > 3M (since angels are plural & masculine by nature)

* ة is mostly used for female/feminine but not always like المَلئكة, عبيدة, طلحة
The ة can be used for other things also

اليُسْرَي > RNJ(non-flexible) 1F

حَدَائِقَ (gardens > BP) > N/J1F (حَدِيْقَةٌ > a garden)
N/J because broken plurals are partly flexible
مِئَتَيْنِ > NJ2F, النَّفْسُ > R1F (feminine because Arabs said so), الْمَآءُ > N1M (not feminine because آءْ)
* When you see combination at the end, status, Number & gender are solved in one shot. For example;
الْمُؤْمِنِينَ > Eena > N/J, Masculine chart, plural column (NJ3M)

Steps to identify broken plural;
(Ending sounds + plural > Always Broken plural)
Step 1 > 1st look for combo then sound (status)
Step 2 > if it is ending sound, look for meaning, it can be singular or plural (Masculine plural, feminine plural, plural because the Arabs said so, broken plural)
Step 3 > if it is a broken plural > human can be she, non-human must be she (singular feminine)
For example;
رِجَالِ (men) > step 1 (it's an ending sound)
Step 2 (its plural by meaning, it doesn't match the 1st 3 plurals so it must be a broken plural)
Step 3 (it's a human broken plural so grammar answer > J1F, reality answer > J3M)

إِمْرَأَةٌ (a woman), نِسآءٌ (women > BP > 3F/1F)
رَجُلٌ (a man), رِجَالٌ (men > BP > 3M/1F)
* Actually not only BP but all non-human plurals can be treated like 'she' i.e. single feminine. For example;
سَمَاوَات > (3FN/J) Or (1FN/J)
Others examples; سَيِّئَات, طَيِّبَات, صَالِحَاتِ, بَيِّنَات, آيَات

Day-5
## Type;
Common vs proper
Common > speaking generally (a car)
Proper > when you are being specific (your car, that car, this car)
Rule > whatever isn't proper is common

Proper;
1. Words with AL (ال) at the beginning
   For example;
   القرآن, المسجد
   * AL (ال) > only have a problem with Tanween, not with a ن in the combination (AL & tanween can't be at the same time like اَلْمُسْلِمٌ)
   * AL (ال) > don't make a word light because in the combination it doesn't do that. Like اَلْمُسْلِمُ vs اَلْمُسْلِمُوْنَ


Masculine Muslim chart with AL;

| جر | نصب | رفع |  |
|---|---|---|---|
| اَلْمُسْلِمِ | اَلْمُسْلِمَ | اَلْمُسْلِمُ | 1 |
| اَلْمُسْلِمَيْنِ | اَلْمُسْلِمَيْنِ | اَلْمُسْلِمَانِ | 2 |
| اَلْمُسْلِمِيْنَ | اَلْمُسْلِمِيْنَ | اَلْمُسْلِمُوْنَ | 3 |

| اَلْمُسْلِمَاتِ | اَلْمُسْلِمَاتِ | اَلْمُسْلِمَاتُ | 3 |

2. Proper names (of person or places like Ibrahim, America)
3. The one being called > when you call a person that becomes
proper even if in the dictionary it is common.
Example in English; dude, man, yu
اَلْخَالِقُ (proper because of AL)
يَا خَالِقُ (proper because of being called)
* There are 4 reasons to make a word light,
  i. If it is a mudhaf (mudhaf is light + no ال)
  ii. Partly flexible
  iii. If you are calling someone. For example;
  
مُسْلِمٌ > يَا مُسْلِمُ

4. Pronouns (he, you etc.)
5. Ismul isharah (pointer words like this, that, these, those)
6. Ism mowsool (اَلَّذِيْ, اَلَّذِيْنَ, مَا, مَنْ)
7. The word before 'of' if the word after 'of' is proper

اللّٰهُ > J1MP (gender > ALLAH isn't male/female but in
grammar we have to give gender, it doesn't means that
ALLAH is male/female)

إِبْرَهِيْمَ > N/J1MP (N/J because it is partly flexible)

الضَّالِيْنَ > N/J3MP (proper because of AL)

Fragments;
More than a word, less than a sentence
Mudhaf (مضاف) & mudhaf ilaih (مضاف اليه);
In English > the word before 'of' is called mudhaf & the word
after 'of' is called mudhaf ilaih.
For example;
The house of ALLAH
The religion of Islam
My car > car of mine
ALLAH's book > book of ALLAH
His pen > pen of his
Mariam's glasses > glasses of Mariam
Owner of the day of judgement (the day is mudhaf & mudhaf ilaih
at the same time, playing two roles)

In Arabic;
* Mudhaf > light + No AL
* Mudhaf ilaih > jaar
* Mudhaf can be raf, Nasab or jaar. For example;
رَسُوْلُ اللّٰهِ
رَسُوْلَ اللّٰهِ
رَسُوْلِ اللّٰهِ

اِخْوَةُ يُوْسُفَ اِخْوَةَ يُوْسُفَ اِخْوَةِ يُوْسُفَ (Yusuf is partly flexible >
therefore N&J look the same)

مَسْجِدُكَ مَسْجِدَكَ مَسْجِدِكَ
Your masjid (doer > raf > مَسْجِدُكَ) offered (fil) a new
program. I visited your masjid (detail > nasab > مَسْجِدَكَ). The
color of your masjid (after of > jaar > مَسْجِدِكَ) is white.
* Mudhaf & mudhaf ilaih together are called idhafa (اضافة)
* Mudhaf & mudhaf ilaih both should be isms & mostly 'of' is
in between in English translations
* Mudhaf & mudhaf ilaih is always together, nothing comes in
between them in Arabic
* Normally a word should be heavy but when it is light, you
would be asking yourself why in the world are you light? &
one of the popular reason is that it is a mudhaf
* No one name/person can never be a mudhaf, the word
ALLAH in the Quran can be mudhaf ilaih but never be a
mudhaf
* In English when you translate mudhaf & mudhaf ilaih you
put 'the' even if mudhaf ilaih is common. For example;
رَسُوْلُ اللّٰهِ > the messenger of ALLAH
مِثْقَالَذَرَّة > the weight of a mosquito

Examples; 1st word should be light + no Al followed by jaar
رَسُوْلُ اللّٰهِ > the messenger of ALLAH
رَبِ الْعَرْشِ > master of the throne
اِسْمِ اللّٰهِ > in the name of ALLAH
رَبِ الْعَالَمِيْنَ > master of the world of people (eena can be N/J,
therefore it is jaar because it is mudhaf ilaih)
الرَّحمْٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ > not idhafa because the 1st word has AL
رَبِ النَّاسِ > master of the people
مَلِكِ النَّاسِ > king of the people
اِلٰهِ النَّاسِ > God of the people (اله has no AL in it)
شَرِ الْوَسْوَاسِ > evil of the whisperer
صُدُوْرِ النَّاسِ > chest of the people
مَلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِيْنِ > master of the day of judgment (يوم is both mudhaf
& mudhaf ilaih at the same time)
اِبْنِ مَرْيَمَ > the son of Maryam (As) (Maryam is a non-Arab name
therefore partly flexible > can be N/J, here it is J because it is
mudhaf ilaih)
* Mudhaf will give you 3 properties but not the 4th one (type),
you will borrow it from mudhaf ilaih.
For example;
رَبِ الْعَالَمِيْنَ
4 properties of رب > J1M(P) But it will not give you the 4th
one, for type you will look at mudhaf ilaih

4 properties of العالميْن > J3MP
دِيْنُ قَوْمٍ
4 properties of دين > R1M(C)
4 properties of قوم > J3MC
* Properties of the whole idhafa would be that of mudhaf,
mudhaf speaks for the whole idhafa
For example;
In the last example
Properties of mudhaf > R1MC
Properties of mudhaf ilaih > J3MC
Properties of the whole idhafa > R1MC
Other example;
ذِكْرُ رَحمَْةِ رَبِّكَ
ذِكْرُ > mudhaf (R1MP) (proper because mudhaf ilaih كَ at the
end of the chain is proper)
رَحمَْةِ > mudhaf ilaih + mudhaf
رَبِّكَ > mudhaf ilaih + mudhaf (كَ > mudhaf ilaih)
The 4 properties of this whole idahfa will be that of mudhaf
ذِكْرُ

Harf of Jaar;
These are harf > doesn't make sense by itself, something has to
come after them & what comes after them is ism & that ism
becomes jaar because of them. In simple words they make next
word (which should be ism) jaar.
* The harf of jaar & its ism should be right next to each other

* In Arabic there are only 2 reasons why something should be
jaar
  i. If it is mudhaf ilaih (because mudhaf ilaih comes after
  'of', so it should be jaar) like بَيْتُ مُسْلِمِيْنَ
  ii. If it is beaten by harf of jaar like بِ مُسْلِمِيْنَ
* Harf of jar (جر) > jaar (جار) & its victim becomes majroor
(مجرور)
For example;
فِِ الْمُسْلِمِيْنَ
فِِ > jaar, الْمُسْلِمِيْنَ > majroor
* If you see a word of jar & its victim, it can never be mudhaf
& mudhaf ilaih because mudhaf & mudhaf ilaih both should
be isms
* Nothing comes in between jaar maajroor
* In jaar majroor > the 1st word is a harf (harf of jar) & the 2nd
is an ism

Harf of jaar table;

| For have (pronoun لَ all else لِ) | Like (comparison) كَ | Swear by ALLAH only تَ | with بِ |
|---|---|---|---|
| About/away from عَنْ | In/about فِِْ | From/because of (not مَنْ) مِنْ | Oath (not وَ for 'and') وَ |
| To/towards إِلي | until حَتَّ | On/upon/against عَلَ |  |

Examples;
وَاللّٰهِ, أَعُوْذُ بِاللّٰهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ, أَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ, بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ, بِأَصْحَابٍ, فِِْ تَضْلِيْلٍ, بِحِجَارَةٍ مِنْ سِجِيْلٍ, كَعَصْفٍ, وَالْعَصْرِ, فِِْ خُسْرٍ, بِالْحَقِّ, بِالصَّبْرِ

* When the harf of jaar ل is attached to the word ALLAH, the alif
is dropped. This isn't the case with other harf of jaar
لِلّٰهِ, وَاللّٰهِ, بِاللّٰهِ, فِِْ اللّٰهِ, مِنَ اللّٰهِ

Harf of nasab;
Makes next word nasab
* Something should be nasab because
  i. It's a detail of a fil
  ii. Beaten by harf of nasab
* Harf of nasab & its ism becomes ism + that harf of nasab

For example;
إِنَّ الْمُسْلِمِيْنَ
إِنَّ > harf of nasab, الْمُسْلِمِيْنَ > ismu إِنَّ

Harfs of nasab chart;

| As though/as if كَأَنَّ | that أَنَّ | Certainly/for sure إِنَّ |
|---|---|---|
| however لَكِنَّ | Alas (express regret) لَيْتَ | because بِأَنَّ |
| So that/hopefully/maybe لَعَلَّ |  |  |

Examples;
إِنَّ الْإِنْسَانَ, إِنَّ الْمُتَّقِيْنَ

إِنَّ الْمُتَّقِيْنَ (eena > can be N/J > nasb due to harf of nasab)
بِالْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ > (eena can be N/J > jaar due to harf of jaar)

بِ يُوْسُفَ (partly flexible > can be N/J > jaar due to harf of jaar)
لَكِنَّ يُوْسُفَ (partly flexible > can be N/J > nasb due to harf of
nasab)
* In harf of nasab & its ism > the 1st word is a harf & the 2nd is an
ism
* Harf of nasab + its ism can be together/can be far away apart
For example;
Right next to each other > إِنَّ الْإِنْسَانَ لَفِْ خُسْرٍ

Apart from each other > إِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِيْنَ مَفَازًا (inna can't make ل nasab
because it is harf of jar, it can't make متقيْن nasab because
nothing comes in between jaar majroor)
Long distance between إِنَّ & َلَيَات in surah 2;164
Mix examples of mudhaf & mudhaf ilaih, jaar majroor, harf of
nasab & its ism; (identify each one)
كِتَابُ اللّٰهِ, مِنَ اللّٰهِ, مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيْمَ, بِإِبْرَاهِيْمَ, عَلَ مُحَمَّدٍ, عَلَ إِبْرَاهِيْمَ, عَلَ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
عَلَ آلِ إِبْرَاهِيْمَ, بِرَبِ الْعَالَمِيْنَ, إِنَّ اللّٰهَ, لَكِنَّ اللّٰهَ, لَعَلَّ اللّٰهَ, لَيْتَ الْمُسْلِمَ,
كَآيَةٍ وَلَكِنَّ الظّٰلِمِيْنَ بِآيَاتِ اللّٰهِ (و isn't the harf of jar here because after a
harf of jar an ism should come which isn't the case here)

Day-6
Pronouns;
* Are always proper
* The 1st column is singular, 2nd is pair & 3rd is plural (in the last 2,
the 1st one (أَنَا) is singular & the 2nd one (نَحْنُ) can be pair/plural)
* Gender is obvious from the meanings (the gender of I & we can be
understood from the context)
* The independent pronouns are always raf, no matter how they
sound (pronouns are crazy)
* The attached pronouns are always nasab/jaar, no matter how they
sound (pronouns are crazy)
* The attached ones come at the end, never comes by itself
* The masculine plural (هُمْ, أَنْتُمْ) can be used for both men & women
* Pronouns can be used for non-living things

* انت at the beginning > you will be present in the translation
* Attached pronouns from انت > replace انت by ك
* The independent pronouns can never be part of mudhaf & mudhaf
ilaih (because they are always raf & can't be N/J)

Pronouns chart;

| هُمْ (they) | هُمَا (both of them) | هُوَ (He) | 3rd person pronouns |
|---|---|---|---|
| هُمْ/هِمْ | هُمَا/هِمَا | هُ/هِ |  |
| هُنَّ (they f) | هُمَا (both of them) | هِيَ (she) |  |
| هُنَّ/هِنَّ | هُمَا/هِمَا | هَا |  |
| أَنْتُمْ (you all) | أَنتُمَا (both of you) | أَنْتَ (you) | 2nd person pronouns |
| كُمْ | كُمَا | كَ |  |
| أَنْتُنَّ (you all f) | أَنْتُمَا (both of you f) | أَنْتِ (you f) |  |
| كُنَّ | كُمَا | كِ |  |
| نَحْنُ (we) | أَنَا (I) |  | 1st person pronoun |
| نَا | ي/نِْ |  |  |

* How انت is attached in فَأَنْتَ if it's an independent pronoun?
There are some words in Arabic that have no grammatical effect,
they are neutral & can sit on anything & of them one letter is ف

* إِنَّأ > if you want to attach إِنَّ (harf of nasab) to attached version of
نَحْنَ that is نَا > it would becomes إِنَّنَا > short version > إِنَّأ
For example, in the Quran;
نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُوْنَ
Three 'we' is used here, it's used when someone is angry or
someone is making a strong argument
* Some of the attached pronouns have 2 versions that's used based
on the sounds preceding it most of the time but not always
If the sound coming before it is A/U > use the dhamma version
& if it is I > use the kasrah version
For example;
هُمْ/هِمْ > هُمْ is used in رَبُّهُمْ & رَبَّهُمْ because the sound before it is A
& U
هِمْ is used in رَبِّهِمْ because the sound before it is I
Others examples;
أَنْعَمْتَ عَليْهِمْ, مَغْضُوْبِ عَلَيْهِمْ
* In أَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ the ه isn't the attached pronoun rather it is part of the
word ALLAH
* ل is a weird harf of jaar, when it comes with an ism its لِ but when
it comes with a pronoun its لَ like لِلّٰهِ & لَهُ (except for attached
pronoun ي of أَنَا, where it is لِ like لِيْ)
* When there is harf of jaar, you can't put an original pronoun with it
but rather an attached ones & the attached pronouns will be jaar in
such cases like بِهِ, بِهِمْ, بِكَ, لَكَ, لَكُمْ, فِيْهِ, فِيهِمَا, فِيْهِمْ, فِيْكُمْ
* Similarly attached pronouns with the harf of nasab will be nasab in
such cases like

إِنَّهُ, أَنَّهُ, كَأَنَّهُ, بِأَنَّهُ, لَيْتَهُ, لَكِنَّهُ, لَعَلَّهُ
* Whenever in Arabic you have ism + attached pronoun, it is 100%
mudhaf & mudhaf ilaih & the attached pronouns will be jaar in
such cases like كِتَابُكَ, رَبُّنَا (pronouns can be mudhaf ilaih because they are isms)
قَمِيْصُكَ, رَبِيْ, رَبُّهُ, رَبِّهِ (in both cases attached pronoun ه is jaar because it is
mudhaf ilaih, don't be misguided by the ending sounds because
pronouns are crazy, they don't care about ending sounds)
* How would you know if an attached pronoun is N/J, it depends on
to what it is attached to?
  i. If it's attached to an ism it's jaar
  ii. If it's beaten by a harf of jaar it's jaar
  iii. If it's beaten by a harf of nasab it's nasab
  iv. If it's attached to a fil, it's nasab
Examples of 1st 3;
رَبُّنَا بِنَا إِنَّنَا, مَسْجِدُكَ بِكَ إِنَّكَ
* If an attached version of أَنَا (ي/نِْ) is attached to فِِْ > فِيِّْ
* اَللَّهُمَّ > it's a special way of saying Ya ALLAH, it's not a pronoun
(هُمْ) attached to the word ALLAH because only م is added, ه is
already part of the word ALLAH
* When the hart of jaar عَلَ & إِلي is attached to a pronoun it becomes
عَلَيْ & إِلَيْ
Like > عَلَيْكَ, اَلسَّلَّامُ عَلَيْكُمْ, إِلَيْكَ

Day-7
Mowsoof sifah;
When two words match in all 4 statuses then the 2nd word becomes the
adjective (صفة) of the 1st word i.e. noun (موصوف) no matter what
flexibility is/ or who is light & heavy
For example;
مُسْلِمٌ صَالِحٌ (a good Muslim) all 4 properties match of both (R1MC)
* Mowsoof (noun) 1st & sifah (adjective) 2nd
* In English adjective 1st > good Muslim
In Arabic adjective 2nd > مُسْلِمٌ صَالِحٌ
* All 4 properties match
* Multiples sifah possible for one mowsoof (an ugly green car)
* Mowssof sifah can have long distance relationship
* When 2 isms come together, it comes under 2 popular conditions
  i. Mudhaf & mudhaf ilaih
  ii. Mowsoof sifah
* The adjective (sifah) of a BP can be 1F/3F
For example;
سَيِّئَات كَبِيْرَة
سَيِّئَاتكَبِيْرَات
* The adjective (sifah) of قوم,ناس,قرن can be plural because these
words are singular in meanings but they are treated like plural
because the Arabs said so. For example;
قَرْنًا آخَرِيْنَ (N3MC)
مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِيْنَ (J3MP)

Quran time;
ذُو ذَا ذِي > R, N, J (the one of/the possessor of) > always mudhaf,
the next word is always mudhaf ilaih
وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُوْ الْجَلَالِ وَ الْإِكْرَامِ (وجه is mudhaf, رب is mudhaf ilaih &
mudhaf, ك is mudhaf ilaih, ذو is mudhaf & ذو الجلال والإكرام is
mudhaf ilaih)
The 4 properties of وجه & ذو matches (R1MP) so the possessor of
glory & honor is describing the face of your master (it is a sifah of
it)
اِسْمُ رَبِّكَ ذِي الْجَلَالِ وَ الْإِكْرَامِ (same grammar as the above except
replace the وجه by اسم)
Here 4 properties of ذي & ربك matches (J1MP) so the possessor of
glory & honor is describing your master.
Others examples;
مُسْلِمًا صَالِحًا, طَالِبَة مُسْلِمَة, طَالِبَات مُسْلِمَات, اَلطَّالِبَاتُ اَلْمُسْلِمَاتُ, اَلعَبْدُ الْمُؤِمِنُ
كِتَابٌ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللّٰهِ مُصَدِّقٌ > 4 properties match (R1MC)
سُرُرٌ مَرْفُوْعَةٌ > 4 properties match (R1FC)
أَكْوَابٌ مَوْضُوْعَةٌ > 4 properties match (R1FC)

Quran time;
3 scenarios of people of Jannah having drinks
i. People drinking by themselves
يَشْرَبُوْنَ مِنْ كَأْسٍ (they will drink from cups)
ii. People to whom drinks will be served
يُسْقَوْنَ فِيْهَا كَأَسًا (they will be given drinks in cups)
iii. People to whom ALLAH will serve drinks (may ALLAH
makes us all among these آلّٰهُمَّ آمِيْن)
وَ سَقَاهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ شَرَابًا طَهْورًا (their master will give them pure drink)

تَنْزِيْلَ الْعَزِيْزِ الرَّحِيْمِ (the revelation of the final authority, the always
loving & caring)
العزيز الرحيم isn't mowsoof sifah, whenever the word ALLAH isn't
mentioned with the other descriptions of ALLAH, then those
descriptions aren't mowsoof sifah of each other, this is بدل (we will
study it later)

Grammar of Bismillah;
بِسمِ اللّٰهِ الرَّحمْٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ (in the name of ALLAH the extremely loving &
caring, the always loving & caring/in the name of extremely loving &
caring & always loving & caring ALLAH)
بِ > harf of jaar
اِسْمِ > majroor
اِسْمِ > mudhaf (light + no AL)

اللّٰهِ > mudhaf ilaih (jaar)
اللّٰهِ > J1MP (mowsoof)
الرَّحمْٰنِ > J1MP (sifah 1)
الرَّحِيْمِ > J1MP (sifah 2)

Grammar of the 1st 3 ayah of surah fatiha;
أَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ ؟ الرَّحمْٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ ؟ مَلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّيْنِ
لِلّٰهِ > (jaar majrror)
اللّٰهِ > J1MP (mowsoof)
رَبِّ > mudhaf (light + no AL), J1MP (proper because mudhaf ilaih has al)
الْعَالَمِيْنَ > mudhaf ilaih (jaar)
رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ > J1MP (sifah 1)
الرَّحمْٰنِ > J1MP (sifah 2)
الرَّحِيْمِ > J1MP (sifah 3)
مَلِكِ > mudhaf, J1MP (because mudhaf ilaih اَلدِّيْنِ has AL)
يَوْمِ > mudhaf ilaih + mudhaf
اَلدِّيْنِ > mudhaf ilaih

I'll convert the PDF into Markdown format, preserving the structure, tables, and Arabic text with harakat exactly as presented.

# ي مِ ِ لِك ِ يَوْم ِ الِيْن > J1MP (mudhaf ِ ملِك speaks for the whole idhafa), (sifah 4)

Uniqueness of the word ALLAH;
There is a debate about it that it's a word by itself (اللٰه) or is it the
combination of 2 words (ال+ال)
The word ALLAH can't be compared with any other word in
Arabic just as ALLAH can't be compared with other creation
i. You can't write a word in Arabic with both AL (ال) & Ya (يا)
at the same time, like
الرمحن > يا رمحن, اللٰه > يا اللٰه
So it means that هللا is one word not 2, if it was 2 it would be
written as يا ال
ii. When there is no AL on a word it should be heavy but the
Word ALLAH breaks all the rules of Arabic. It doesn't have
AL but still can be written as light like
اللُٰه
الٰلهَ
الٰلهِ
iii. When a word is always light its partly flexible (يُوسُفُ يُوْسُفَ
يُوْسُفُ) but the word ALLAH is always light & still fully
flexible
اللُٰه
الٰلهَ
الٰلهِ
iv. In Arabic tajweed (خمارج), there are light letters (كَ بَا الَ) &
heavy letters (قَاصَا ضَا خَا)
The letter laam in Arabic is light but in the word اللٰه laam is
heavy.

Day-8
Pointer isms (اسم االشارة);
- They are always proper
- They are non-flexible (R, N, J look the same)
- If preceded by harf of jaar > then they are jaar
& if by harf of nasab then they are nasab like
فِيْ هذَا, اِنَّ هذَا
- They can never be mudhaf (because they never have AL)
- When you have a pointer word & there is no AL then 'is' is written
in translation, but if AL is present then 'is' isn't written.
For example;
هذَا الْمَسْجِدُ (this masjid)
هذَا مَسْجِدٌ (this is a masjid)
هذَا كِتَابٌ (this is a book)
هذَا الْقُرآنُ (this Quran)

هذَا الْبَيْتِ > why it isn't translated as this the house (because of AL)
instead of this house?
Translation isn't about translating words, translation is about
translating ideas, in Arabic you can have Al there, in English you
can't have the 'the' there for the same idea

Pointer for nearby things
هِذِهي (this for F)
(these for BP)
هذَا (this for M)
هِؤُالَءي (these for people M+F)

Pointer for things that are far away
تِلْكَ (that for F)
(those for BP)
ذالِكَ (that for M)
أُوْلَءِكَ (those for people M+F)

- There is a 2 Rafa form > هِذَانِ > هِذَانِ خَصْمَانِ (these 2 are
arguing/arguer), إِنْ هِذَانِ لسَاحِرَانِ (these 2 are truly magician)
& there is a 2 N/J form > هِذَيْنِ

Examples;
تِلْكَ الرُسُلُ > those are the messengers (تِلْكَ is used because الرُسُلُ is a BP)
أُوْلَءِكَ هُمُ الْمُتَّقُوْنَ > those are the god conscious people
رَبَّ هذَا الْبَيْتِ > master of this house (هذَا is mudhaf ilaih of رَبَّ)
فِيْ هِذِهِ الْحَيَاةِ > in this life (هِذِهِ is majroor beaten by harf of jaar فِيْ)
تِلْكَ حُدُوْدُ اللٰهِ > those are the boundaries set by ALLAH (boundaries of
ALLAH gives wrong meaning, تِلْكَ is used because حُدُوْدُ is a BP)
أُوْلَءِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ > those are the people of the fire
هِذِهِ نَاقَةُ اللٰهِ > this is the camel of ALLAH
بِهذَا الْحَدِيْثِ > in this speech

هِذِهِ سَبِيْلِيْ > this is my path (why سَبِيْلِيْ isn't the light version of سَبِيْلِيْ)
No 1) because oona/eena is used for people
No 2) if it was light version, then it would be mudhaf of something &
will have mudhaf ilaih after it which isn't the case here)
تِلْكَ آيَاتُ الْكِتَابِ الْحَكِيْمِ > those are the signs of the books
(الْكِتَابِ الْحَكِيْمِ > mowsoof sifah, all non-human plurals are treated as
she that's why تِلْكَ is used for normal human feminine plural آيَاتُ)
ذَالِكَ مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُنْيَا > that is the enjoyment of the lowest life
(الْحَيَاةِ الدُنْيَا is mowsoof sifah, words that ends with ة يآء are feminine
like حُسني, صُغري, كُربي, دني, دني is 4 words د ن ي ي, sometimes it's
written like دنيا > still feminine, when a word ends with alif > its non-
flexible)
تِلْكَ الدَّارُ الَْخِرَةُ > that final house (الدَّارُ الَْخِرَةُ is mowsoof sifah)
هِؤُلَءِ الْقَوْمِ > these nations/this nation (قَوْمِ is a singular word but its
treated plural because the Arabs said so)
هِؤُلَءِ شُفَعَاءُنَا > these are our intercessors.

Sentences (finding the invisible is);
The 5 fragments;
1. Mudhaf & mudhaf ilaih
2. Harf of jaar
3. Harf of nasab
4. Mowsoof sifah
5. Pointer + AL

These fragments are connected with each other so no 'is' is present
between them.
In ism sentences you have to find the invisible 'is' if there is break in the
chain (when there is no connection i.e. it doesn't fall in the above 5
categories)

For example;
اللٰهُ اَكْبَرُ > it isn't a mudhaf & mudhaf ilaih, there is no harf of jaar/nasab,
it isn't mowsoof sifah (4 properties don't match R1MP Vs R1MC), there
is no pointer word, so it doesn't fall in the above 5 categories so you
have to put 'is' in between them > ALLAH is greater
اَلْحَمْدُ للِِٰه > the word ALLAH is beaten by harf of jaar laam so they are
connected with each other but there is no connection between اَلْحَمْدُ & للِِٰه
so 'is' is present between them > praise is for ALLAH
فِيْ قُلُوْبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ > قُلُوْبِ is mudhaf & is beaten by harf of jaar فِيْ so it's
majroor, هِمْ is mudhaf ilaih so they are all connected with each other but
there is no connection between قُلُوْبِهِمْ & مَرَضٌ so 'is' is present between
them > in their heart is disease/sickness
الْحَقْ مِنْ رَّبِكُمْ > break in the chain between الْحَقْ & مِنْ رَّبِكُمْ > the truth is
from your master.

إِنَّ هَذَا عَدُوًّ لَّكَ > there is 2 breaks in the chain (between هَذَا & عَدُوًّ &
between عَدُوًّ & لَّكَ), when there is 1st break in the chain, put 'is'
there, no matter how many breaks in the chain is there, the putting
of another 'is' becomes irrelevant.

it's already starting off a sentence
For example;
هُوَ اللٰهُ > he is ALLAH
اَنَا اللٰهُ > I am ALLAH
هُوَ رَبِ السَّمَاوَاتِ > he is the master of the skies
هُوَ الَْبْتَرُ > he is the most cut off

Day-9
Past tense (فعل ماضي);
- Fil is just one word but it is a full sentence in Arabic
- When you hear (A) at the end of the fil it is هُوَ, هُوَ is inside the fil.
For examples;
نَصَرَ (he helped), اِسْتَمَعَ (he listened carefully), ضَرَبَ (he hit), عَلَّمَ
(he taught), اِسْتَغْفَرَ (he asked for forgiveness), قَاتَلَ (he fought),
سَمِعَ (he heard), قَرُبَ (he came close)
سَمِعَ اللَّهُ لِمَنْ حَمِدَهُ > ALLAH heard the one who praised him

- If you hear (At) at the end of the fil it is هِيَ, هِيَ is inside the fil
For example;
نَصَرَتْ (she helped), اِسْتَمَعَتْ (she listened carefully), ضَرَبَتْ (she
hit), عَلَّمَتْ (she taught), اِسْتَغْفَرَتْ (she asked for forgiveness),
قَاتَلَتْ (she fought), سَمِعَتْ (she heard), قَرُبَتْ (she came close)

- Add alif at the end of the هُوَ fil > means both of them (هُمَا)
For example;
نَصَرَا (both of them helped), اِسْتَمَعَا (both of them listened
carefully)

- Add alif at the end of the هِيَ fil > means both of them (F) (هُمَا)
For example;
نَصَرَتَا (both of them (F) helped), اِسْتَمَعَتَا (both of them (F) listened
carefully)

- Oo (وْا) at the end of a fil > means they (هُمْ)

- Add sukoon + نَ at the end of the هُوَ fil > means them ladies (هُنَّ).
For example;
نَصَرْنَ (they F helped), ضَرَبْنَ (they F hit)

- Add sukoon at the end of the هُوَ fil then add تَ, تُمَا, تُمْ, تِ, تُمَا, تُنَّ >
means the respective pronouns (أَنْتَ, اَنْتُمَا, أَنْتُمْ, أَنْتِ, أَنْتُما, أَنْتُنَّ)

أَنْتَ نَصَرْتَ (you helped), أَنْتُمَا نَصَرْتُمَا (both of you helped),

- Ism have tanween, fil doesn't have tanween
- How to differentiate Oo at the end of the fil from Oo from the light
version of Oona?
The fil will have alif with Oo (وْا) while ism don't have that
- Alif in the end always tell you 2 people like نَصَرَا, نَصَرَتَا, نَصَرْتُمَا

نَصَرَ (nasara) vs نَصَرَا (nasaraa)

هُنَّ (them ladies) vs أَنْتُنَّ (yall ladies)

نَصَرْتَ (تَ > أَنْتَ you) vs نَصَرْتِ (تِ > أَنْتِ you F) vs نَصَرْتُ (تُ > أَنَا I)

Day-10
Present tense (فعل مضارع);
The past tense changes at the end, the present tense changes at the
beginning
If you see;
أَ أُ at the beginning means > I (when ء sits on a letter, that letter becomes
just a sitting chair for the ء)
نَ نُ at the beginning means > we
يَ يُ at the beginning means > he

For examples;
أُؤَذِنُ (I give the adhan), أُسْلِمُ (I accept Islam), أُعَلِمُ (I teach)
نُؤَذِنُ (we give the adhan), نُسْلِمُ (we accept Islam), نُعَلِمُ (we teach)

يُكَذِبُ, يَدُعُ, يحَُضُ, أُصَلِيْ, يُوَسْوِسُ, أَتُوْبُ, نَتُوْبُ, يَنْصُرُ, أُؤْمِنُ, يُؤْمِنُ, نُؤْمِنُ

- When you change the pronoun in the present tense, replace it with
the same sound as it was present before. For example;
يُكَذِبُ > أُكَذِبُ, نُكَذِبُ
يَدُعَ > أَدُعَ, نَدُعَ
- Arabic don't have future tense, the present tense can also be used
for the future
- We hear in the khutbah
اَلْحَمْدُ للِِٰه أَنَحْمَدُهُ وَنَسْتَعِيْنُهُ وَنَسْتَغْفِرُهُ وَنُؤْمِنُ بِهِ وَنَتَوَكَّلُ عَلَيْهِ

seek his help & we ask his forgiveness & we believe in him & we
trust him
