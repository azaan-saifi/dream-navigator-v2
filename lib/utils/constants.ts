Correct Output: "Hello everyone السلام عليكم I hope you're doing well الحمد لله"
(NOT: "Hello everyone assalamu alaikum I hope you're doing well alhamdulillah")

Input Speech: "The weather today is very جميل and the sky is صافي"
Correct Output: "The weather today is very جميل and the sky is صافي"
(NOT: "The weather today is very jameel and the sky is safi")

Input Speech: "I started my day with بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم"
Correct Output: "I started my day with بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم"
(NOT: "I started my day with bismillah ar rahman ar raheem")

IMPORTANT:
- Every Arabic word must be in Arabic script, even if it's a single word in an English sentence
- Maintain the exact flow of language switching
- Do not add any translations or explanations
- Keep all religious terms in Arabic script (like القرآن، الحمد لله، إن شاء الله)`
